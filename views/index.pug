      div.aside
        | The Reporting API is a generic framework to allow reporting for web platform features. 
        | This demo runs code that deliberately violates policies and does other bad things 💥 in order to generate reports. 
      div.aside.error
        | Run this demo in Chrome, version 96 or later (check via chrome://version). 
      div.aside
        | Optionally, to receive reports faster as you're experimenting with this demo, run Chrome with the flag --short-reporting-delay. This flag is not 
        | available via the Chrome UI, it's a command line flag. See  
        a(href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags") how to run Chromium with flags

      li Load this page. Upon loading, this page generates one report of each of these types (if supported by the browser):
        ul
          li CSP violation
          li Deprecation
          li Document policy violation
          li Intervention
          li Permissions policy violation (experimental)
          | It also opens a separate page and by doing so, generates a COOP violation.
      li Open or reload 
        a(href=reportsDisplayUrl)=reportsDisplayUrl
        |  to see all reports.
    div.note ☝️ Note: If you want to generate a crash report, you'll need to do it manually: type chrome://crash/ in your browser from this page.
    div.note 💥 This page has console errors and issues. That's expected: it tries to violate its own security policies, uses deprecated APIs, and does other bad things in order to generate reports.
